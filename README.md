# R_Project

This project should be done in groups of 1, 2, or 3 people (maximum).
Rubric – In order to earn full credit for this project, you must submit all of the data indicated below.
Spread out your work to include multiple pages. Be sure that each individual chart, graph or diagram is not split between pages.  Use R for all diagrams, tables, graphs, and computations.
Your report must be turned in on or before 12-15-2020 for full credit. Be sure to include your names, and all pertinent tables, diagrams, graphs and computations. On the last page, describe in your own words what computational methods you learned in Math 2100 that were used to complete this project.
Data
The spreadsheet entitled “Computer_Stats.xlsx” consists of the mean monthly assembly cost (AC) and the mean monthly percent of profit (PP) earned by a company for the 36 months from 2014 through 2016, columns A to C.  It also contains the assembly cost and the percent of profit for the first 36 days of production during of 2017 following a change in ownership, columns E to G.
## For AC and PP in the 2017 stats, perform the following computations:
	Find the mean, median, mode, and standard deviation s of this sample.
	Create a histogram using your frequency table.
	Draw a boxplot of the assembly costs.
	Use the results from part (a) to find what percentage of the 36 days’ AC is within ±1σ of the mean. (Hint: Assume this sample was NOT taken from a Bell curve.)
	If 35.4% or more is considered a good percentage of profit, what proportion of the 36 days’ PP are 35.4% or more?
	Of those days with PP of 35.4% or more, what percentage of those days were accomplished with an assembly cost of $330 or less?

## Assuming that the mean AC for the first 36 months is normally distributed, do the following:
	Find the mean μ and the standard deviation σ, then find what proportion of AC was between $320 and $350 per month.
	Use the 36 months of statistics to create a scatterplot, with AC on the x-axis and PP on the y-axis.
	Draw in a trend line and calculate the equation for the line of regression.
	Using this equation from part c), approximate to the nearest whole number the percent of profit that could result from requiring an average assembly cost of $340 during the 36 months. Also approximate to the nearest cent the assembly cost that would result in producing an average of 34.7% per month during that same 36 months. 
	Using R, show that the data you used to establish your sample of sample means for the first semester is normally distributed by creating a Normal Quantile Plot (qqnorm).

## Assuming that the 36 days in 2017 are a representative sample and that the 36 days’ AC fit a Normal Distribution Curve, do an estimation of the Mean by establishing a margin of error and a confidence interval of the mean assembly cost recorded during the 36 days. Use a 95% confidence-level.

## For the 36 months from 2014-2016, you calculated the mean monthly AC for the company as well as the standard deviation. Use these as the basis for the mean hypothesis claim, H0.
	Has this changed during the 36 days at the start of 2017?
	State your Alternative Hypothesis.
	Use a significance level of α=0.05 to find a Z-test and a P-value that either supports or rejects the null hypothesis.
	Using the sample of the 36 days in 2017 for the company’s AC, has there been a significant statistical change in the mean AC since 2014? State your conclusion in one descriptive sentence.
